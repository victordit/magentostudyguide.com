<p>In classical MVC architecture view files are html code with output of the logic in templates via php or  any template engine, for example, Smarty (in Prestashop, Oxid) or Twig, Dwoo, Calypso, etc. Working with Magento, you may fall into delusion that everything is extremely complicated, but this complexity allows you to maintain flexibility and modularity.</p>
<p>In Magento there are three components of the template system. As we discussed in a previous article, there are php classes that are stored in modules folder called Block. They load the data from database and transfer it to the PHP/HTML templates in your theme (.phtml files). There are also XML layout configuration files that act as application guides on how to build a page, what to build it with and the behavior of each building block.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Identifying and explaining the main Magento design areas (adminhtml and frontend)</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> <a href="http://blog.belvg.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/magento_design_areas.png"><img class=" wp-image-1391 aligncenter" style="border: 0;" title="magento_design_areas" src="http://blog.belvg.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/magento_design_areas.png" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>All frontend files are stored in three main Magento design areas.</p>
<p><span id="more-1390"></span></p>
<h4>install</h4>
<p>Files from this area will be displayed during the installation process.</p>
<p>Magento enter in this area when he not found the installation date in local.xml</p>
<p>app/etc/local.xml  > gobal/install/date</p>
<pre>
	&#x3C;config&#x3E;
	    &#x3C;global&#x3E;
	        &#x3C;install&#x3E;
	            &#x3C;date&#x3E;&#x3C;![CDATA[Wed, 23 Mar 2016 23:31:21 +0000]]&#x3E;&#x3C;/date&#x3E;
	        &#x3C;/install&#x3E;
	        ...	
</pre>

<h4>admintml</h4>
<p>Everything that you will observe while working in the admin panel can be found here. In other words, if module performs anything related to admin panel, all templates and layouts will be there.</p>
<h4>frontend</h4>
<p>Everything that can be observed on your webstore by any customer is stored there.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;">What does the structure of a complete theme look like?</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> <a href="http://blog.belvg.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/theme_structure1.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-1393 aligncenter" style="border: 0;" title="theme_structure" src="http://blog.belvg.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/theme_structure1.png" alt="" /></a></p>
<h4>Package</h4>
<p>There are two basic packages that come with Magento installation â€“ base and default for Community Edition, base and enterprise for Enterprise Edition and base and pro for deprecated Professional Edition.</p>
<h4>Themes</h4>
<p>Theme is a set of layout, template, locale and skin files, i.e. visual representation of your store. Magento is built with the option of loading multiple themes which can be divided into two major types:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Default theme</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Each package has a &#8216;default&#8217; theme, i.e. the main theme of this interface. Magento automatically searches the default theme and loads it to the front-end. There are two ways of changing a store appearance: either by bringing changes directly to the theme, or, which I personally find better, creating an individual non-default theme.<strong></strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Non-default theme</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Non-default theme can be completely different from the default theme or may contain some images of them. Corrections in CSS file, layout file and all the rest will be loaded from the interface default theme.
